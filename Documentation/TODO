TODO list:

doc useflags
 - we need to think about it once more and split it onto userdoc and apidoc, where we should pick which one will stand for doc useflag
   and which one will stand for documentation for developers.

dev-util/kdevelop:
 - KDevelop uses dev-libs/check and dev-util/cppunit if available (for plugin/xtest)
   * does not use the usual macro_optional_add stuff, so we can't use the cmake stuff in our eclasses to select
   * if pkgs are not available at compile time, xtest is not built
   * should we make that a USE? Or just always depend on those? Patching CMakeLists.txt to not include them if not wanted?

ebuilds:
 - check missing ebuilds in live slot (comparing cmakelists probably)
 - clean up Documentation/stasis
 - libkholidays still includes test stuff. can that be taken out?
 - dont know really about FindMarbleWidget.cmake 
 - kapptemplate needs to be checked again when kbindings is available?
 - kdesdk-kioslaves, i dont know about the dev-util/kdesvn collision
 - does dragonplayer really need xine-lib dep?
 - kdesdk-misc, kpalettes doesnt do anything, scheck disabled in cmakelists.txt
 - fix virtuoso and make it actualy usable

TESTS:
 - run test for each application and coordinate with upstream if fails
 - don't add RESTRICT=test to ebuild, remove it from the ones which fail currently
   and add codeblock to eclass where it will be added to all relevant PNs

SHINY:
 - write some application that could be run on d.ge.o and show the state of ebuilds (compiled fine/died)
 - generate some nice look&feel - icons/themes/kdm
 - create some reasonable default config for kde, when user first log in so he has configured it a bit (ie. create icons on desktop onto some gentoo sites)

Periodic work:
 - each month check if there are new applications in live that need packaging

KDE3
 - create the overlay and its users where we can let them maintain it
 - from september start slowly moving kde3 misc apps from main tree to the created overlay
 - removal of kde3 should be finished with release of KDE 4.4
