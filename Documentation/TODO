TODO list:

doc useflags
 - needs to be tested that for handbook the linguas detection is working fine.

KDE upstream tracking map.
 - some application that would show us what parts of kde we dont have implemented yet. So we could see what ebuilds we need to add.

dev-util/kdevelop:
 - KDevelop uses dev-libs/check and dev-util/cppunit if available (for plugin/xtest)
   * does not use the usual macro_optional_add stuff, so we can't use the cmake stuff in our eclasses to select
   * if pkgs are not available at compile time, xtest is not built
   * should we make that a USE? Or just always depend on those? Patching CMakeLists.txt to not include them if not wanted?

kdebindings:
 - create new ebuilds for all various things.
 - php, java, c#...

kdepim:
- do something with nepomuk_email_feeder and ontologies (moved away from kdepim-runtime)
- do something with examples
- add kdepim-runtime as RDEPEND-only to some kdepim packages

ebuilds:
 - check missing ebuilds in live slot (comparing cmakelists probably)
 - kapptemplate needs to be checked again when kbindings is available?
 - kdesdk-kioslaves, i dont know about the dev-util/kdesvn collision
 - kdesdk-misc, kpalettes doesnt do anything, scheck disabled in cmakelists.txt

TESTS:
 - run test for each application and coordinate with upstream if fails
 - don't add RESTRICT=test to ebuild, remove it from the ones which fail currently
   and add codeblock to eclass where it will be added to all relevant PNs

SHINY:
 - write some application that could be run on d.ge.o and show the state of ebuilds (compiled fine/died)
 - generate some nice look&feel - icons/themes/kdm
 - create some reasonable default config for kde, when user first log in so he has configured it a bit (ie. create icons on desktop onto some gentoo sites)

Periodic work:
 - each month check if there are new applications in live that need packaging

KDE3
 - from september start slowly moving kde3 misc apps from main tree to the kde-sunset overlay
 - removal of kde3 should be finished with release of KDE 4.4
