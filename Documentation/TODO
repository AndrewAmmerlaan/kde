TODO list:

eclasses review:
 - drop mono / split code
 - add code for multi-slot (off by default)
 - add a symlink function to avoid building libs twice
 - KMLOADLIBS/KMSAVELIBS review
 - kbuildsycoca review

kdebase-startkde:
 - fix the multi kde versions mess
 - fix KDEDIRS

dev-util/kdevelop:
 - KDevelop uses dev-libs/check and dev-util/cppunit if available (for plugin/xtest)
   * does not use the usual macro_optional_add stuff, so we can't use the cmake stuff in our eclasses to select
   * if pkgs are not available at compile time, xtest is not built
   * should we make that a USE? Or just always depend on those? Patching CMakeLists.txt to not include them if not wanted?

ebuilds:
 - complete bump
 - check missing ebuilds
 - add unstable / missing ebuilds? (kpackage)
 - add testing snapshots? (amarok/k3b)
 - libkholidays still includes test stuff. can that be taken out?
 - dont know really about FindMarbleWidget.cmake 
 - kapptemplate should be checked again when kbindings is available?
 - kopete needs some love
 - kdesdk-kioslaves, i dont know about the dev-util/kdesvn collision
 - does dragonplayer really need xine-lib dep?
 - does kuser need knotify dep?
 - kdesdk-misc, kpalettes doesnt do anything, scheck disabled in cmakelists.txt
