I ve just removed the following categories and packages

x11-libs/
www-client/arora
dev-util/qt-creator
Documentation/package.unmask/qt-4.5
Documentation/package.unmask/qt-copy
sets/qt-split


** profiles/categories has been updated **

Those packages are now located on qting edge overlay. Qting edge is a Qt specific overlay. 

You can add it via layman using 

layman -a qting-edge .
