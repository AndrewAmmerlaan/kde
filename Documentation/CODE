WHAT RULES I SHOULD FOLLOW WHEN I WANT WORK ON SOMETHING FOR KDE TEAM?
If you asked this question you are reading right file.

So the rules are these:
 - always use kde4-* eclasses
 - always report cmake issues about everything directly to upstream and backport their fix
 - never use -j1 in ebuilds. Always report the issue upstream and wait for the resolution or fix yourself
 - doubleckeck the doc useflag in your package
 - think about adding debug useflag to your package
 - always check for linguas and add them to the KDE_LINGUAS variable
 - always fix automagic packages with macro_optional_ prefixing and report it upstream with patch.
 - check your apps deps with dylink scanner in maintainer folder
 - if you want our herd in the application and you are not kde team HT/Member ask us first
 - if you create blocker make sure it is in RDEPEND and comment the reason why you created the blocker

KDE 3
 - do what ever you want with one condition, make sure it really compiles/run
 - feel free to commit patches without kde team ack if the above condition is checked

# NOT FOLLOWING THIS RULES WILL BE PUNISHED!
# no cookies for week!
