Agenda topics for the next KDE team meeting
-------------------------------------------

1. Roll call (5 minutes)

2. KDE SC stabilization (15 minutes)
   * Discuss/vote the options:
   a) First 4.8.5 as decided in a former meeting, then 4.9.1 / 4.9.2.
   b) Skip 4.8.5, start with 4.9.0 / 4.9.1 directly.
   c) Other?

3. Solaris patches (5 minutes)
   * We apply many patches to support Solaris, but there seems to be no prefix
   keyword. Does anyone know anything about them? If we are supporting Solaris,
   Kensington would like to push these patches upstream. Does anyone have
   access to a box to test if they are still useful?

4. Bugs (30 minutes)
   * kde-base/kmail-4.9.0 fails compiling with gcc-4.4.7
   https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=429742

   * app-cdr/k3b: Excessive use of REQUIRED_USE (and wrong combination
   USE="lame"+"encode") REQUIRED_USE was added, otherwise USE="-encode lame"
   does nothing. https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=417235

   Options:
	1. Revert to original behaviour - we don't care that USE="-encode lame"
	does nothing
	2. Keep the REQUIRED_USE, but rename lame -> mp3
        3. Drop the encode flag, but move the optional RDEPS to an elog
        4. Drop the encode flag and keep optional RDEPS (current behaviour)

   * app-office/calligra-2.4.3: move fonts to separate packages
   https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=427910

   * www-client/rekonq-1.0: please move Nunito-Regular.ttf to separate package
   https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=427914

5. Open floor (15 minutes)
