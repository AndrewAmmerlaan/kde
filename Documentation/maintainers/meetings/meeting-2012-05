Agenda topics for the next KDE team meeting
-------------------------------------------

1. Roll call (5 minutes), big welcome for the new team members!

2. Add LINGUAS support to cmake-utils.eclass (5 minutes)
   * Discuss/vote: Add basic LINGUAS support to cmake-utils.eclass, where LANGS
   is automatically expanded to IUSE+=" linguas_${lang}" (see qt4-r2). About 10
   packages currently do something with LINGUAS, compare to about 16 with qt4-r2.

3. Live KDE ebuilds are unconditionally test restricted (5 minutes)
   * Discuss/vote: Add a condition so that tests are run. Is I_KNOW_WHAT_I_AM_DOING
   going to be disruptive for existing users?

4. KDE 4.8 stabilization and powerpc (15 minutes)
   * gcc 4.7 needed!? https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=402989
   * ppc64 never stabilized
   * Does the support of ppc/ppc64 makes realy sense nowadays?
   * Discuss/vote:
	(a) Drop ppc64 from kde-base and reverse dependencies
	(b) Drop ppc from kde-base and reverse dependencies

5. Bugs (30 minutes)
    * Trying to change full name in KDE System Settings results in error or crash
    chfn parsing is broken. Do we want to apply a workaround (like Ubuntu) and
    disable that field to prevent crashes?
    https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=380899

   * app-cdr/k3b: use media-libs/musicbrainz:3 instead of :1
   Testing indicates that we can drop the dep completely, any objections?
   https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=410347

   * dev-util/cmake: FindPythonLibs behaviour broken by Gentoo patches
   https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=405181

   * kde-misc/networkmanagement-0.9.0 and kde-misc/networkmanagement-0.8_p20110714 wrong doc dir specified
   https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=410139

   * kde-misc/interceptor - KDE4 Plasmoid - intercept (catch) the log info from the syslog
   Seems like there's way too much work here for a simple plasma applet, and has a lot of
   trouble with permissions on the FIFOs.
   https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=383733

   * dev-util/cmake-2.8.6-r4 - stop Xvfb after failed test phase
   cmake-utils calls "die" if tests fail, so the code to stop Xvfb is never run.
   This may also be an issue for any future VIRTUAL_DBUS.

5. Open floor (15 minutes)
