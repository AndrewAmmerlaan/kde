Agenda topics for the next KDE team meeting
-------------------------------------------

1. Roll call (5 minutes)

2. Move KDE 4.8.4 to the tree, and in which variant? (5 minutes)
   It seems that the problems have been solved with a) newer soprano or b) reverted commit.
   Which way do we want to go?

3. Once it's out, should we move KDE 4.9.0 to the tree? (10 minutes)
   Currently 4.8.90 looks quite solid, so this is a real option.

4. Bugs (30 minutes)
   * app-cdr/k3b: Excessive use of REQUIRED_USE (and wrong combination USE="lame"+"encode")
    REQUIRED_USE was added, otherwise USE="-encode lame" does nothing
    Options:
        1. Revert to original behaviour - we don't care that USE="-encode lame" does nothing
        2. Keep the REQUIRED_USE, but rename lame -> mp3
        3. Drop the encode flag, but move the optional RDEPS to an elog
        4. Drop the encode flag and keep optional RDEPS (current behaviour)
