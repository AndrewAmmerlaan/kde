agenda suggestions

0) electing new lead
1) status regarding hal
2) should we try to form a "stable kde devs" team? meaning just call for volunteers on the dev ml?
3) kde-git/eclasses migration and status, move kdepim 4.6 beta in tree masked
4) Shall we drop useflags kdeenablefinal and/or kdeprefix to simplify code?
5) Dropping of semantic-desktop useflag with guide update (mostly even kdebase needs it on now)
6) Making +consolekit and +policikit or removing the useflags as whole (non working stuff run-as is annoying)
7) AT/overlay/bugzie access policy
8) livedvd issues
9) documentation status
10) 4.6 (and misc apps with 4.6) status
11) early discussion about 4.6 stabilization
