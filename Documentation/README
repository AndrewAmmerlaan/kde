Hi. Welcome to the kde overlay.

This overlay is a testing ground for the kde team. This is where
we'll test new ideas before applying them in the tree. It is also
the main repository for KDE live ebuilds and weekly snapshots.

Installation instructions (and a full Gentoo KDE guide) can be
found at http://kde.gentoo.org/kde4-guide.xml

eix stuff:
we all know that eix takes a long time to complete.
i set up a server who generates metadata-cache, you can use it to speed up update-eix drastically.

ATTENTION perhaps your overlay path may vary

##1. execute metadata-sync in the Documentation directory - sorry, the server slackie.soylent.eu is down :(
2. edit /etc/eixrc:
OVERRIDE_CACHE_METHOD="/usr/local/portage/layman/kde metadata-assign"

everytime you sync the overlay, you have to sync the metadata manually again, i dont have a proper solution for that atm

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR >=KDE-4.2.65 AND LIVE KDE4 USERS

Some packages (notably kde-base/pykde4:4.3 and kde-base/pykde4:live) require some yet unreleased packages:
- dev-python/sip
- dev-python/PyQt4
They are maintaned in Official Qt Team Overlay (qting-edge), so please grab them from there.

layman -a qting-edge (or use your favourite method to do it)
