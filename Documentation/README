Hi. Welcome to the kde overlay.

This overlay is a testing ground for the kde team. This is where
we'll test new ideas before applying them in the tree.

eix stuff:
we all know that eix takes a long time to complete.
i set up a server who generates metadata-cache, you can use it to speed up update-eix drastically.

ATTENTION perhaps your overlay path may vary

1. execute metadata-sync in the Documentation directory
2. edit /etc/eixrc:
OVERRIDE_CACHE_METHOD="/usr/local/portage/layman/kde-testing metadata-assign"

everytime you sync the overlay, you have to sync the metadata manually again, i dont have a proper solution for that atm
