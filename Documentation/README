Hi. Welcome to the kde overlay.

This overlay is a testing ground for the kde team. This is where
we'll test new ideas before applying them in the tree. It is also
the main repository for KDE live ebuilds and weekly snapshots.

Installation instructions (and a full Gentoo KDE guide) can be
found at http://kde.gentoo.org/kde4-guide.xml


eix stuff:
we all know that eix takes a long time to complete.
i set up a server who generates metadata-cache, you can use it to speed up update-eix drastically.

ATTENTION perhaps your overlay path may vary

put this into /etc/eix-sync.conf:
	@cd /var/lib/layman/kde/Documentation && sh ./metadata-sync

Your local git copy will almost always be newer than what the metadata mirror server had.
	Hence in addition to the above, you might want to put this into .git/hooks/post-update:
	https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/ExampleScripts#Setting_the_timestamps_of_the_files_to_the_commit_timestamp_of_the_commit_which_last_touched_them
	WARNING: Doing this is usually considered DANGEROUS and can break stuff in unexpected ways!


IMPORTANT NOTE FOR >=KDE-4.2.65 AND LIVE KDE4 USERS

Some packages (notably kde-base/pykde4:4.3 and kde-base/pykde4:live) require some yet unreleased packages:

They are maintaned in Official Qt Team Overlay (qting-edge), so please grab them from there.
